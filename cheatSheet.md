## [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

Actually Chrome's V8 engine is written in C++ and also Chrome and Node.js is also mainly written in C++. While running the JavaScript codes, they both passes the C++ bindings and handles our code as may be seen in this [schema](https://ibb.co/7bx3rxF).

Of course there are slight differences between JavaScript on browser and on Node.js.
### General
- `node -v` checks the current version of Node.js
- `node file_name.js` will simply run the script via terminal.
